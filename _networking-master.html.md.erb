1. For **Router IPs** **HAProxy IPs**, see the following guidance:
	* For AWS, Azure, and GCP, leave these fields blank. You do not need to complete these fields when deploying PCF on these infrastructures.
	* For Openstack and vSphere, the values you enter in the **Router IPs** and **HAProxy IPs** fields depend on whether you are using HAProxy in your deployment. Use the table below to determine how to complete these fields.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to assign specific IP addresses in either the <strong>Router IPs</strong> or <strong>HAProxy IPs</strong> field, ensure that these IP addresses are in the subnet that you configured for PAS in Ops Manager.</p>
	    <table border="1" class="nice" >
	      <tr>
	        <th><strong>Using HAProxy?</strong></th>
	        <th><strong>Router IPs Field</strong></th>
	        <th><strong>HAProxy IPs Field</strong></th>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
	        <td>No</td>
	        <td><ol>
	        <li>Choose IP addresses from the subnet you configured in Ops Manager.</li>
	        <li>Enter these IP addresses in the <strong>Router IPs</strong> field. You should specify more than one IP address for high availability.</li>
	        <li>Configure your load balancer to forward requests for the domains that you have configured for your deployment to these IP addresses.</li>
	        </ol></td>
	        <td>Leave this field blank.</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>

1. For **SSH Proxy IPs** and **TCP Router IPs**, see the following guidance:
	* For AWS, Azure, and GCP, leave these fields blank. You do not need to complete these fields when deploying PCF on these infrastructures.
	* For Openstack and vSphere:
		* (Optional) In **SSH Proxy IPs**, add the IP address for your Diego Brain, which will accept requests to SSH into application containers on port `2222`.
  			<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you have mutual TLS app identity verification enabled, app containers accept incoming communication only from the Gorouter. This disables <code>cf ssh</code>.</p>
		* (Optional) In **TCP Router IPs**, add the IP address(es) you would like assigned to the TCP Routers. You enable this feature at the bottom of this screen.
  			<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you have mutual TLS app identity verification enabled, app containers accept incoming communication only from the Gorouter. This disables TCP routing.</p>
