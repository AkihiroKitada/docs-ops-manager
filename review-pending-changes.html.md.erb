This topic describes the **Review Pending Changes** page and how to selectively deploy individual or multiple tiles in Ops Manager. Deploying tiles selectively can drastically reduce deployment time.

<%= image_tag("review-pending-changes.png", :alt => "Screenshot of the 'Review Pending Changes' page. For a description of each labeled section, see the list below.") %></a>

The following list describes each labeled section of the **Review Pending Changes** page:

- **A**---**BOSH Director:** The BOSH Director tile is always enabled and always deploys. In the screenshot, the BOSH Director tile has a green border to indicate that it is fully configured.

- **B**---**Apply Changes Checkbox:** Enable the checkbox next to each product tile you want to deploy. The product tile displays the specific version of the product staged for deployment. You cannot deploy any tiles that display an orange bar. The orange bar indicates missing required configuration. A green bar indicates that the product tile is configured and ready for deployment. A red bar indicates that the product tile is pending deletion. 

- **C**---**Depends on:** This section lists tile dependencies and versions. If you choose to deploy a tile that has dependencies, you must also deploy all of that tile's dependencies in the same deployment. For example, if a tile is missing its required stemcell, the text "Missing stemcell" or "Stemcell out of date" displays. Tiles cannot deploy without its required stemcell. Go to **Stemcell Library** to upload the correct stemcell. For more information, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

- **D**---**Changes:** This section lists pending changes to the tile. For example, this may include product or stemcell version upgrades or an indication that the tile is staged for deletion.

- **E**---**Errands:** If you expand this section, you can enable or disable errands that trigger when that tile deploys. For example, you may enable an errand to log properties. For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **F**---**Apply Changes:** Clicking this button deploys all enabled tiles and their dependencies.

If a product fails to deploy after you **Apply Changes**, it remains listed on the **Review, the page remains listed the pending changes that did not complete.
