This topic describes the _Review Pending Changes_ page and how to selectively deploy
individual or multiple tiles in Ops Manager. Deploying tiles selectively can drastically
reduce deployment time.

The following screenshot shows the _Review Pending Changes_ page. Features called out with
red letters are described below.

	    Changes' page. For a description of each labeled section, see the list
	    below.") %></a>

The following list describes each labeled section of the _Review Pending Changes_ page:

- **A**---**Apply Changes Checkboxes:** The checkboxes next to each product tile allow you to enable
the tiles you want to deploy. Each tile displays the version of the product staged for
deployment. The tiles are in one of the three following colors:

  - **Green**---Tile is configured and ready for deployment.

  - **Orange**---Tile is not fully configured. You cannot deploy an orange tile.

  - **Red**---Tile is pending deletion.

- **B**---**BOSH Director:** The BOSH Director tile always deploys, so its Apply Changes
checkbox is always enabled.

- **C**---**Depends on:** This section lists tile dependencies and versions. If you choose
to deploy a tile that has dependencies, you must also deploy all of that tile's
dependencies in the same deployment.

- **D**---**Warnings:**---Red text in orange tiles indicates changes you need to make before you deploy the tile.
You might see some of the following warnings:

    - **Missing stemcell**---You must import and stage a stemcell with Stemcell Library. The warning
    links to the Stemcell Library.

    - **Stemcell out of date**---You must update the stemcell of your tile in Stemcell
    Library. For more information, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

    - **Configuration is incomplete**---You must complete the configuration of your tile.

    - **Configuration is invalid**---You must resolve your tile's invalid configurations.


- **E**---**Changes:** This section lists high-level pending changes to the product.
If the tile attempts and fails to deploy, Ops Manager keeps
your new configurations but clears the list of changes. To see if your product deployed successfully, see
[Change Log Page](./pcf-interface.html#changelog).<br><br>
    You may see the following high-level changes:

    - Tile deletion is staged.

    - Tile version is updated.

    - Stemcell is updated.

- **F**---**Errands:** If you expand this section, you can enable or disable errands that trigger when that tile
deploys. For example, you may enable an errand to log properties. For more information,
see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](./managing_errands.html).

- **G**---**Apply Changes:** Clicking this button deploys all enabled tiles and their
dependencies.
