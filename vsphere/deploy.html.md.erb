<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions for deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Ops Manager to VMware vSphere.

The instructions in this topic are based on vSphere 6.5 using the vSphere Client (HTML5) interface.

## <a id="pas_and_pks"></a> Runtime Considerations

For security purposes, VMware requires a dedicated instance of Ops Manager for use with Pivotal Container Service (PKS). 

Do not deploy Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on the same instance of Ops Manager as PKS. 
For more information, 
see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/pas-and-pks.html">PAS and PKS Deployments with Ops Manager</a>.

<p class="note warning"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you are installing PKS on vSphere with NSX-T integration, 
follow the instructions in
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html">Deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for PKS</a>
instead of performing the steps described in this topic.</p>

## <a id="prepare-vsphere"></a> Prepare vSphere

1. Log into vCenter using the vSphere Client (HTML5).

1. Select the vSphere Datacenter where you are deploying Ops Manager.

1. Create one or more vSphere clusters. A vSphere cluster is a collection of ESXi hosts and associated virtual machines (VMs) 
with shared resources and a shared management interface.<br/><br/>
     To create a vSphere cluster:
    1. Right-click the vSphere Datacenter object.
    1. Select **New Cluster**. 
    1. Name the Cluster. For example, `Cluster1`.
    1. Select **Turn ON vSphere DRS** to enable DRS. Set DRS Automation to be **Partially Automated** or **Full Automated**.
    1. Select **Turn ON vSphere HA** to enable vSphere HA.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For highly available, production-ready environments, you need to create more than one cluster. Create as many vSphere clusters as needed for the type of environment you are building. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/refarch/vsphere/vsphere_ref_arch.html#high-availability">Compute and HA Considerations</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/refarch/vsphere/vsphere_ref_arch.html#scaling">Scaling and Capacity Managment</a> sections of the vSphere Reference Architecture.</p>

1. Create a resource pool for the management components in your deployment. Resource pools are vSphere objects used to organize resources. 
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The management resource pool separates non-HA components such as Ops Manager and BOSH Director. 
    For example, if you are deploying Ops Manager for use with PKS, the PKS management plane includes Ops Manager, BOSH Director, 
    the PKS control plane, and Harbor (optional).</p>
    
    To create a vSphere resource pool:
    1. Right-click the vSphere cluster object you created.
    1. Select **New Resource Pool**.
    1. Name the resource pool. For example, `RP-MGMT`.
    1. Review the default CPU and Memory settings and adjust if necessary. This is not common.
    1. Click **OK**.

## <a id="deploy"></a> Deploy Ops Manager

  Ops Manager for vSphere is provided as an OVA file. An OVA file is a template for a virtual machine (VM). To deploy Ops Manager on vSphere, you import the OVA file into your vSphere environment.

1. Download the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager for vSphere](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) OVA file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io). Use the **Releases** dropdown menu to select an Ops Manager release.

1. Right-click the management resource pool you created and select **Deploy OVF Template**. Alternatively, from the vCenter menu, select **Actions** > **Deploy OVF Template**.

1. At the **Select an OVF template** screen, click **Browse**.

1. Select the Ops Manager OVA file you downloaded and click **Open**.

1. Review template selection and click **Next**.

1. At the **Select a name and folder** screen: 
    * Enter a name for the Ops Manager virtual machine, or use the default name.
    * Select the **Datacenter** object.
    * Click **Next**.

1. At the **Select a compute resource** screen, select the compute resource where the Ops Manager VM will run and click **Next**.
    Select the Resource Pool for the management components.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vsphere/vsphere_om-deploy-02.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Hardware virtualization must be turned off if your vSphere host does not support VT-X/EPT. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/vsphere.html#vsphere-reqs">Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on vSphere</a> topic for more information.</p>

1. At the **Review Details** screen, confirm the configuration up to this point and click **Next**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vsphere/vsphere_om-deploy-03.png") %>

1. At the **Select Storage** screen, select the virtual disk format. 
    1. Choose the desired Datastore. 
        * If you are using vSAN, select the vSAN datastore and apply the default storage policy.
        * If you are using a dedicated disk, select the appropriate disk format for your deployment needs. If in doubt, choose **Thin Provision**. For more information about disk formats, see [vSphere Virtual Disk Types](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/disk-format.html).

## <a id="deploy"></a> Start Ops Manager

1. Create a DNS entry for the IP address that you used for Ops Manager. 

    You must use this fully qualified domain name when you log into Ops Manager.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager security features require you to create a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager during the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/vsphere.html#paas">initial configuration.</a></p>

1. Select the Ops Manager VM and click **Actions** > **Power** > **Power On**. 

    Once the VM boots, the Ops Manager web interface is available at the IP address you specified.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is normal to experience a brief delay before the interface is accessible while the web server and VM start up.</p>

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is normal to experience a brief delay before the interface is accessible while the web server and VM start up.</p>
