title: Ops Manager Fields That Lock On Deploy
owner: OpsManager
---

Some fields in Ops Manager lock during deployment. Not all fields lock, but the ones that do lock to prevent irrevocable VM malfunction, deployment corruption, and data loss. Most users will not need to edit these fields after initial deployment.

However, locking these fields permanently prevents you from reconfiguring some aspects of an Ops Manager instance after initial deployment. Users with evolving deployment requirements may find that restriction too severe for reasonable use.

To accomodate the need for deployment modification over time, you can unlock and reconfigure some of the locked fields after deployment. Unlocking locked fields requires you to use Ops Manager's Advanced Mode. For more information about Advanced Mode, see [Unlockable fields](#unlock).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Pivotal recommends that only skilled operators use Ops Manager's Advanced Mode. If you use Advanced Mode incorrectly, you could disable or destroy your deployment.</p> 


## <a id='unlock'></a>Unlockable fields

This section describes the fields that lock during deployment and can be unlocked and configured after deployment. To unlock these fields, you must use Ops Manager's [Advanced Mode](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager). 

After you have enabled Advanced Mode, you can use the API or Ops Manager UI to reconfigure some fields that were locked previously. Those fields are listed in the following section. 

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Pivotal recommends that only skilled operators use Ops Manager's Advanced Mode. If you use Advanced Mode incorrectly, you could disable or destroy your deployment.</p>

### <a id="product-tiles-locked"></a>Locked fields in product tiles

No additional fields lock automatically in third-party product tiles. However, tile authors can specify which fields should lock on deploy by passing the `freeze-on-deploy` flag. For more information about this flag, see [Common property blueprint attributes](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-2/property-reference.html#common-attributes LINK TO 2.3 DOCS).
