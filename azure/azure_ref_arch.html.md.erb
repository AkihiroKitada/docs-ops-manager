<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This guide presents a reference architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on Azure. 

Azure does not provide resources in a way that maps to traditional PCF availability zones. Therefore, high availibility in Azure is provided via [availability sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-manage-availability).

All reference architectures described in this topic are validated for production-grade PCF deployments using multiple (3+) availability sets. 

## <a id="arch_diagram"></a> Base Reference Architecture 

The following diagram provides an overview of a reference architecture deployment of PCF on Azure.

### <a id="base_components"></a> Base Reference Architecture Components

The following table lists the components that are part of a base reference architecture deployment on Azure using a single resource group. 

|**Component**| **Reference Architecture Notes**|
|--------------------|------------|
|**Domains & DNS** | CF Domain Zones and routes in use by the reference architecture include: domains for *.apps and *.system (required), a route for Ops Manager (required), a route for doppler (required), a route for loggregator (required), a route for ssh access to app containers (optional) and a route for TCP routing to apps (optional). Azure reference architecture uses .... as the DNS provider. |
|**Ops Manager**| Deployed on the infrastructure subnet and accessible by FQDN or via an optional Jumpbox. |
|**BOSH Director** | Deployed on the infrastructure subnet. |
|**Azure Load Balancer - API & Apps**| Required. Load balancer that handles incoming API and apps requests and forwards them to the Gorouter(s). |
|**Azure Load Balancer - ssh-proxy** | Optional. Load balancer that provides SSH access to app containers. |
|**Azure Load Balancer - tcp-router**| Optional. Load balancer that handles TCP routing requests for apps. |
|**Azure Load Balancer - MySQL** | Required? Load balancer to provide high availability for MySQL? |
|**Gorouter(s)**| Accessed via the HTTP and TCP WebSockets load balancers. Deployed on the ERT subnet, one job per Azure availability set. | 
|**Diego Brain(s)**| This component is required, however the SSH container access functionality is optional and enabled via the SSH Proxy load balancer. Deployed on the ERT subnet, one job per Azure availability set. |
|**TCP Router(s)** | Optional feature for TCP routing. Deployed on the ERT subnet, one job per availability zone.|
|**MySQL**| Reference architecture uses internal MySQL ?? Deployed on the ERT subnet, one job per Azure availability set. |
|**Elastic Runtime**| Required. Deployed on the ERT subnet, one job per Azure availability set.
|**CF Blob Storage and Buckets** | For buildpacks, droplets, packages and resources. Reference architecture uses ... ? Does it use internal file storage? |
|**Storage Accounts**| PCF on Azure requires 5 storage accounts - BOSH, Ops Manager, and three ERT storage accounts. |
|**Service Tiles**|Deployed on the PCF managed services subnet. Each service tile is deployed to an availabilty set. |
|**Dynamic Services**| Reserved for future use, dynamic services are deployed on their own subnet. |


## <a id="common_network"></a> Alternative Network Layouts for Azure ##

This section describes the possible network layouts for PCF deployments as covered by the reference architecture of PCF on Azure. 

At a high level, there are currently two possible ways of deploying PCF as described by the reference architecture:

1. Single resource group, or
2. Multiple resource groups.

The first scenario is currently outlined in the [existing installation documentation](../../customizing/azure.html) for Azure deployments of PCF. It models a single PCF deployment in a single Azure Resource Group.

If you require multiple resource groups, you may refer to the [Multiple Resource Group deployment](#multiple_resource_groups) section.

### <a id="base-network-layout"></a> Network Layout

This diagram illustrates the network topology of the base reference architecture for PCF on Azure. In this deployment, you expose only a minimal number of public IPs by using a NAT and deploy only one resource group.

### <a id="network_components"></a> Network Objects

The following table lists the network objects expected for each type of reference architecture deployment with three availability zones (assumes you are using NATs).

|**Network Object**| **Notes**| **Minimum Number: One Resource Group** | **Minimum Number: Multiple Resource Groups**|
|--------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **External Public IPs** |  Use 1) global IP for apps and system access 2) Ops Manager (or optional Jumpbox). Optionally, you can use a public IPs fro the ssh-proxy and tcp-router load balancers. | 2 | ? |
| **SNATs** | | ? | 0 |
| **Virtual Network** | One per deployment. Azure virtual network objects allow multiple subnets with multiple CIDRs, so a typical deployment of PCF will likely only ever require one Azure Virtual Network object. | 1 | 1 |
| **Subnets** | Separate subnets for 1) infrastructure (Ops Manager, Ops Manager Director, Jumpbox) 2) ERT 3) services 4) dynamic services. Using separate subnets allows you to configure different firewall rules due to your needs. | 4 | 4 |
| **Routes** | Routes are typically created by Azure dynamically when subnets are created, but you may need to create additional routes to force outbound communication to dedicated SNAT nodes. These objects are required to deploy PCF without public IP addresses. | 3+ | 3|
| **Firewall Rules** | Azure firewall rules are bound to a Virtual Network object and can be created to use IP ranges, subnets, or instance tags to match for source & destination fields in a rule. | 12+ | ?+ |
| **Load balancers**| Used to handle requests to Gorouters and infrastructure components. Azure uses 1? or more load balancers. The HTTP load balancer is required. The TCP Router load balancer used for TCP routing feature and the SSH load balancer that allows SSH access to Diego apps are both optional. The HTTP load balancer provides SSL termination. MySQL Load Balancer? | 1+ | 1+ |
| **Jumpbox** | Optional. Provides a way of accessing different network components. For example, you can configure it with your own permissions and then set it up to access to Pivotal Network to download tiles. Using a Jumpbox is particularly useful in IaaSes where Ops Manager does not have a public IP. In these cases, you can SSH into Ops Manager or any other component via the Jumpbox. | (1) | (1)|

### <a id="multiple_resource_groups"></a> Multiple Resource Group Deployment

This diagram illustrates the case where you want to additional resource groups in your PCF deployment on Azure.

###<a id="multi-resgroup-notes"></a> Multiple Resource Groups Deployment Notes
In this deployment, the key design points are:

* Dedicated `Network` Resource Group, limits BOSH Service Principal so that it does not have admin access to network objects.
* Custom Role for BOSH Service Principal, applied to `Network` Resource Group, limiting to minimum access.
