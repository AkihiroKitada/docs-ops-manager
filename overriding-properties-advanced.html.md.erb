title: Overriding Manifest Properties in Advanced Mode
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how you can use Advanced Mode to override some manifest properties.
This allows you to change properties that you cannot change through the Ops Manager UI.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

How the overrides work...

You can edit the properties in the following sections of the manifest:

+ Network
+ BOSH instance group
+ Runtime config

You cannot edit properties in other sections of the manifest.
For example, you cannot add or delete an arbitrary instance group.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you can override manifest properties, you must set Ops Manager to Advanced Mode.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that
only skilled operators use Ops Manager's Advanced Mode.
If you use Advanced Mode incorrectly, you can disable or destroy your deployment.
</p>

[//]: # (Change the above warning into a partial that can be used consistently. See "Ops Manager Fields That Lock on Deploy")

To set Ops Manager to Advanced Mode, follow the instructions in [How to Enable Advanced Mode
in the Ops Manager](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager?language=en_US)
in the Knowledge Base.

## <a id="bosh-overrides"></a> Override BOSH Director Manifest Properties

You can override certain properties in the BOSH Director Manifest.

You can use the `/api/v0/staged/director/overrides`
Ops Manager API endpoint to override properties in the BOSH Director manifest.
With this endpoint, you can only override properties that are
in the instance groups and networks sections of the manifest.

For information on the Ops Manager API endpoints related to this feature, see [Advanced Manifest Configuration](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/opsman-api/#tag/Advanced-Manifest-Configuration) in Ops Manager API Documentation.

For information about enabling Advanced Mode using the Ops Manager API, see [Advanced Mode](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/opsman-api/#tag/Advanced-Mode) in Ops Manager API Documentation.

## <a id="runtime-config-overrides"></a> Override Runtime Config Properties

You can override the runtime config properties in the BOSH Director manifest.

You use the `/api/v0/staged/director/runtime_configs/overrides` endpoint in the runtime configs
to override properties:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Runtime Config Names</th>
    <th>Add-on Names</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ops_manager_dns_runtime</code></td>
    <td><ul>
      <li><code>bosh_dns</code></li>
      <li><code>bosh_dns_windows</code></li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ops_manager_system_metrics_runtime</code></td>
    <td><ul>
      <li><code>system_metrics_agent</code></li>
      <li><code>system_metrics_agent_windows</code></li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, although you cannot change the log level for the BOSH DNS logs through the Ops Manager UI,
you can change the log level using the <code>/api/v0/staged/director/runtime_configs/overrides</code> endpoint.
Increase the log level to `DEBUG` for more information
or decrease the level for less verbose logs.
