	![This image depicts the HSTS configuration fields for HAProxy. Explanations of these fields follow.](images/haproxy-hsts-enable-fields.png)
	* *Maximum age** in seconds for the HSTS request. HAProxy forces HTTPS requests from browsers for the duration of this setting. The maximum age is one year, or 31536000 seconds.
	* Enable the **Include subdomains** checkbox to force browsers to use HTTPS requests for all component subdomains.
	* Enable the **Enable preload** checkbox to force instances of Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that access your HAProxy to refer to their built-in lists of known hosts that require HTTPS, of which HAProxy is one. This ensures that the first contact a browser has with your HAProxy is an HTTPS request, even if the browser has not yet received an HSTS header from HAProxy.
