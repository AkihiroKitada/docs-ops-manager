title: Disabling Ops Manager Verifiers
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how to disable and re-enable verifiers for fields in the BOSH
Director and other product tiles.

Ops Manager provides this option for troubleshooting
purposes. For example, you can unblock a deployment with a unique configuration that the
verifier cannot detect.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal recommends contacting support before you
disable Ops Manager verifiers.</p>

<p class="warning note"><strong>WARNING:</strong> When you disable a verifier, your
verifier is disabled persistently through major and minor Ops Manager updates. Keep a
record of the verifiers you disable.</p>

## <a id="about-verifiers"></a> About Verifiers

Ops Manager verifiers reach out and find objects in the world. For example, given an IP, a
verifier can ping the IP to see that it responds.

If a verifier fails, Ops Manager displays an error message with the `type` of your
verifier. You can use the verifier type to disable verifiers with the Ops Manager API.

Verifiers run on two occasions:

- When you click **Save** in a pane. If the verifier fails, the error message is a
warning. Your configuration still saves.

- When you click **Apply Changes**. If the verifier fails, Ops Manager blocks you from
deploying. Disabling verifiers unblocks deployment.

## <a id="disable"></a> Disable Verifiers by Type

You can disable verifiers by verifier type. For example, you can disable all MySQL
verifiers for a tile. To disable a verifier type for a tile, you
must find and record the type, then use the Ops Manager API.

### <a id="record-type"></a> Step 1: Record the Verifier Type

To record the verifier type, do the following:

1. Log in to Ops Manager and go to **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** and see the verifier error message.

1. Record the `type` in the verifier error message. For example,
`WildcardDomainVerifier`.

<%= image_tag("verifier-error.png", :alt=>"The Ops Manager screenshot shows the following
	      error: The domain '*.apps.example.com' failed to resolve,
	      type:WildcardDomainVerifier") %>

### <a id="api-put"></a> Step 2: Use the Ops Manager API

To disable verifiers, you must use the Ops Manager API. To get started with
the Ops Manager API, follow the procedures in [Using the Ops Manager API](./ops-man-api.html).

The API endpoint varies by tile. Go to one of the procedures below:

- [Disable Verifiers for the Bosh Director Tile](#bosh-director-disable)

- [Disable Verifiers for Other Tiles](#tile-disable)

#### <a id="bosh-director-disable"></a> Disable Verifiers for the BOSH Director Tile

To disable a verifier type for the BOSH Director, do the following:

1. Run the following API command:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/VERIFER-TYPE" \
     -X PUT \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "enabled": false }'
     ```

    Where:
    - `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.
    - `VERIFIER-TYPE` is the verifier type you recorded in [Step 1: Record the Verifier Type
](#verifier-type).
    - `UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN` is your UAA access token. For more information, see [Access the
    API](./ops-man-api.html#access-api). 

    For more information about this endpoint, see [Turning off a verifier for the
    director](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#turning-off-a-verifier-for-the-director)
    in the Ops Manager API documentation.

1. To confirm your verifier type is disabled, run the following command:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time" \
     -X GET \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    ```

    And see output similar to the following. See `false` corresponding to your
    verifier type:
    <pre class="terminal" style="height: 300px; scroll: auto;">
{
  "verifiers": [
    {
      "type": "AllocatedIpAddressVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "AvailabilityZonesVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "DirectorConfigurationVerifier",
      "enabled": false
    },
    {
      "type": "IaasConfigurationVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "NetworksExistenceVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "NetworksPingableVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "type": "PrivilegeVerifier",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

    For more information about this endpoint, see [Retrieving a list of install time
    verifiers for a specific
    product](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#retrieving-a-list-of-install-time-verifiers-for-a-specific-product)
    in the Ops Manager API documentation.

#### <a id="tile-disable"></a> Disable Verifiers for Other Tiles

To disable a verifier type for tiles other than the BOSH Director, do the following:

1. Run the following command and record the `guid` corresponding to your product.

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products" \
    -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```
    See the following example output:
    <pre class="terminal">
    [
  {
    "installation_name": "component-type1-installation-name",
    "guid": "component-type1-guid",
    "type": "component-type1"
  },
  {
    "installation_name": "p-bosh-installation-name",
    "guid": "p-bosh-guid",
    "type": "p-bosh"
  }
  ]
    </pre>
    For more information about this endpoint, see [Listing all staged
    products](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsman-api/#listing-all-staged-products)
    in the Ops Manager API Documentation. 


## <a id="re-enable"></a> Re-enable Verifiers by Type

To re-enable verifiers, follow the steps detailed in [Disable Verifiers](#disable) above. Instead of setting `enabled`
to `false`, set it to `true`.
