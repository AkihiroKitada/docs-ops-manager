In Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), you can back up CredHub and its data with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR). For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

Ensure you also back up your encryption key; otherwise, you will not be able to restore your BBR backups. See [Backing Up the Encryption Keys](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/credhub/backup-restore.html#encryption-keys).
