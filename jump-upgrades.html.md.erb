This topic describes upgrading to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.2 directly from  <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.4 and later.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Jump upgrading describes the process of skipping minor versions when upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Jump upgrading enables you to upgrade directly to the long-term support (LTS) version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>, which is v2.10. <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 is supported through April 2024. For more information, see [Long-Term Support for Ops Manager v2.10](release-notes.html#lts) in _<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 Release Notes_.


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade:

* If you are on <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or earlier, you must upgrade to v2.4 before you can jump upgrade to v2.10.2.

* You must upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.2 or later.

* To upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10, you must ensure that the products you have installed are compatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.2. To create an upgrade path for your product tiles, see the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

* You must have no changes to any product tile or service instance currently staged.

* If you are using vSphere with NSX-T, you must have NSX-T v2.3 or later installed.

* You have installed Trusty stemcell 3541 or later.
