owner: Ops Manager

This topic describes upgrading to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.2 directly from
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.4 and later.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Jump upgrading describes the process of skipping minor versions when upgrading
<%= vars.ops_manager %>. Jump upgrading enables you to upgrade directly to the
long-term support (LTS) version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>, which is v2.10.
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 is supported through April 2024. For more
information, see [Long-Term Support for Ops Manager v2.10](release-notes.html#lts)
in _<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 Release Notes_.


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.2:

* If you are on <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or earlier, you must upgrade to
v2.4 before you can jump upgrade to v2.10.2.

* You must upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.2 or later.

* To upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10, you must ensure that the products
you have installed are compatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.2. To create
an upgrade path for your product tiles, see the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

* You must have no changes to any product tile or service instance currently staged.

* If you are using vSphere with NSX-T, you must have NSX-T v2.3 or later installed.

* You have installed Trusty stemcell 3541 or later.


## <a id="jump-upgrade"></a> Jump Upgrade

After you ensure your deployment meets the requirements described in
[Prerequisites](#prequisites) above, you can upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %>
to v2.10.2 or later.

To jump upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> to v2.10.2 or later:

1. Review the table in [Address Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) below
and address any breaking changes that apply to your current <%= vars.ops_manager %> version.

1. Follow the procedure in [Upgrading Ops Manager](install/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id="breaking-changes"></a> Address Breaking Changes

The table below describes what could happen if there are breaking changes
that affect your current version of <%= vars.ops_manager %> and how to address
them before upgrading:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Upgrading From</th>
		<th>What Could Happen</th>
		<th>How to Avoid</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>v2.4</td>
		<td>Your pipline jobs break due to outdated product filenames.</td>
		<td><%= vars.ops_manager %> release artifacts are renamed for smoother automation.
			If you use automation scripts or other tools to access release artifacts,
			update them to match the new filename scheme. For more information, see <a href="https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/ops-manager-2-5-changing-the-file-naming-scheme-might-break-the-pipeline-jobs?language=en_US">Ops Manager 2.5 changing the file naming scheme might break the pipeline jobs</a>

			to SSH onto the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. For more information, see
