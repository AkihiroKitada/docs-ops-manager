In the **File Storage** pane, you determine where you would like to place your Cloud Controller's file storage.

1. Select **File Storage**.

1. To set the maximum number of recent, valid packages your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum valid packages per app** field. Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`. However, you may want to lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. To set the maximum number of recent, valid droplets your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Maximum staged droplets per app** field. Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`. However, you may want to lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. Under **Configure file storage backup level**, select which blobstores you want to exclude when backing up your file storage:
	* **Complete File Storage Backup* includes all blobstores in your backups.
	* **Exclude droplets from file storage backup** excludes droplets from your backups. For this option to take effect, you must restage PCF.
	* **Exclude droplets and packages from file storage backup** excludes droplets and packages from your backups. For this option to take effect, you must run `cf push`.

1. For **Configure your Cloud Controller's filesystem**, see [Configuring File Storage for PAS](./pas-file-storage.html).
