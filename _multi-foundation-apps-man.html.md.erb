This section describes how to configure **Apps Manager** to display information from other foundations in addition to the
foundation it is installed on. For more information about the **Multi-Foundation** configuration settings, see 
[Multi-Foundation Apps Manager](../opsguide/multi-foundation-apps-man.html)

Given foundation A (where you want to configure Multi-Foundation Apps Manager), and foundation B.

Steps to make foundation A able to connect to foundation B:

1. Select **Apps Manager** in A. The following image shows the **Apps Manager** page.

1. Find the section labeled "Multi-foundation Configuration (BETA)". 
Enter a JSON describing the foundations you would like to connect to this foundation. 
The following an example JSON for the Foundations JSON.

"B Name" is the configured foundation name.
Note that `metricsUrl` below is optional - set this if metrics is installed for a foundation.

```json
{
  "B Name": {
    "ccUrl": "https://api.b-foundation-system-domain.com",
    "systemDomain": "b-foundation-system-domain.com",
    "usageServiceUrl": "https://app-usage.b-foundation-system-domain.com",
    "invitationsServiceUrl": "https://p-invitations.b-foundation-system-domain.com",
    "logoutUrl": "https://login.b-foundation-system-domain.com/logout.do",
    "metricsUrl": "https://metrics.b-foundation-system-domain.com",
    "uaaUrl": "https://login.b-foundation-system-domain.com"
  },
  ... // For foundations C, D, and E add other entries here that follow B's pattern.
}
```

1. In B's UAA, the `apps_manager_js` client should have A's Apps Manager URL (https://apps.a-foundation-system-domain.com) 
as a valid redirect URI. This is necessary so that Apps Manager on Foundation A can redirect to B's UAA and back while 
logging in. For more information about UAA clients and their redirect-uri, see [Client.redirect-uri](../uaa/uaa-concepts.html#redirect-uri)

To configure this via [UAAC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac):
```
uaac target uaa.b-foundation-system-domain.com
uaac token client get admin -s ${admin client credentials in OpsManager}
uaac client update apps_manager_js --redirect_uri '${previous redirect uris},https://apps.a-foundation-system-domain.com/**'
```

It is currently not possible to configure this via OpsManager.

1. If B is configured to use certificates that are not already trusted (e.g. signed by a globally-trusted CA),
you will need to add the signing CA certificate(s) that signed B's certificates as trusted by A's BOSH Director.
This allows Apps Manager on foundation A to validate the certificates used on B's endpoints (e.g. B's Cloud Controller).
For more information about setting the trusted certificates in BOSH, see [Setting Trusted Certificates](../customizing/trusted-certificates.html)

**Strongly encouraged**
1. Have UAA configured on both A and B to use the same external SAML identity provider (e.g. Okta). They must be configured
with the same "Provider Name" on each foundation. This allows Apps Manager to automatically log in with your identity
provider on each foundation so you don't have to enter a username/password for each one, each time you log in.
For more information on UAA and identity providers, see [Identity Providers in UAA](../uaa/identity-providers.html)
For more information on how to setup identity providers in UAA with OpsMan, see [Adding Existing SAML or LDAP Users to a PCF Deployment](../opsguide/external-user-management.html)
