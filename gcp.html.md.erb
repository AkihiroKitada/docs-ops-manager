<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

It includes resource requirements, prerequisites, instructions for installing PCF on GCP, and additional resources. 

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

You can install PCF on GCP on either the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Pivotal Container Service (PKS) runtime. There are resource requirements specific to each runtime. Ensure you meet the requirements for your runtime and the requirements specific to GCP before installing PCF on GCP.

## <a id="requirements"></a> Requirements

This section lists the following resource requirements for installing PCF on GCP:

* General PCF resource requirements. See [PCF Resource Requirements](#general-requirements).
* GCP-specific resource requirements. See [GCP Resource Requirements](#gcp-requirements).

### <a id="general-requirements"></a> PCF Resource Requirements

This section lists PCF resource requirements for installing PCF on GCP. It includes general PCF resource requirements for both the PAS and PKS runtimes.

View one of the following, depending on your PCF runtime:

* PAS-specific PCF resource requirements. See [PAS Resource Requirements](#pas).
* PKS-specific PCF resource requirements. See [PKS Resource Requirements](#pks).

#### <a id="pas"></a> PAS Resource Requirements

The following are general resource requirements for deploying and managing a PCF deployment with Ops Manager and PAS:

* PAS requires sufficient IP allocation. The following lists the minumum required IP allocations:
  * One static IP address for either HAProxy or one of your Gorouters
  * One static IP address for each job in the Ops Manager tile. See the Ops Manager **Resource Config** pane for each tile for a full list. 
  * One static IP address for each job listed below:
      * Consul
      * NATS
      * File Storage 
      * MySQL Proxy 
      * MySQL Server
      * Backup Restore Node
      * HAProxy
      * Router
      * MySQL Monitor
      * Diego Brain
      * TCP Router
  * One IP for each VM instance created by the service.
  * An additional IP address for each compilation worker. Use the following formula to determine the total IPs required: `IPs needed = static IPs + VM instances + compilation workers`.
  * Pivotal recommends that you allocate at least 36 dynamic IP addresses when deploying Ops Manager and PAS. BOSH requires additional dynamic IP addresses during installation to compile and deploy VMs, install PAS, and connect to services.
* Pivotal recommends using a network without DHCP for deploying PAS VMs.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you have DHCP, refer to the <a href="./troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Guide</a> to avoid issues with your installation.</p> 

#### <a id="pks"></a> PKS Resource Requirements

For PKS-specific resource requirements, see [GCP Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/gcp-requirements.html).

### <a id="gcp-requirements"></a> GCP Resource Requirements

The following are GCP-specific resource requirements for installing PCF on GCP:

* Your GCP project must have sufficient quota to deploy all the VMs needed for a PCF installation. For a list of suggested quotas, see [Recommended GCP Quotas](./gcp-quotas.html).

* The following are the GCP account permissions required to set up a GCP environment for PCF:
   * The following permissions are required to create firewalls, networks, load balancers, and other resources:
     * **Compute Engine** > **Compute Instances Admin (beta)**
     * **Compute Engine** > **Compute Network Admin**
     * **Compute Engine** > **Compute Security Admin**
   * To use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for Cloud Controller file storage, the following permission is required to create buckets:
     * **Storage** > **Storage Admin**
   * To use Cloud DNS, the following permission is required to add and modify DNS entries:
     * **Project** > **Editor**

* Installing PCF on GCP requires a minimum of the following VM instance limits in your GCP account. The number of VMs required depends on the number of tiles and availability zones you plan to deploy. The following VM guidelines apply to the PAS and Small Footprint PAS runtimes:

  * **PAS**: At a minimum, a new GCP deployment requires the following `custom` VMs for PAS and Ops Manager:
<table border='1' class='nice'>
  <tr>
    <th width ="33%">VM Count</th>
    <th width ="33%">vCPU Count per VM</th>
    <th width ="33%">RAM (GB)</th>

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>If you are deploying a test or sandbox PCF that does not require high availability, then you can scale down the number of VM instances in your deployment. For more information, see <a href="../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html">Scaling PAS</a>.</p>

  * **Small Footprint PAS**: At a minimum, a new GCP deployment requires the following VMs to run Small Footprint PAS:

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

To install PCF on GCP, you must do the following:

* Install the Google Cloud SDK on your machine and authenticate it to your GCP account. To download the Google Cloud SDK, see [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

* If necessary, request a quota increase for your GCP project. For GCP quota requirements, see [GCP Resource Requirements](#gcp-requirements). To request an increase, see [Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) in the GCP console.

* Increase or remove the VM instance limits in your GCP account. For VM instance requirements, see [GCP Resource Requirements](#gcp-requirements).

* <a name="#env_account"></a> Update your GCP account with the required permissions. For account permissions requirements, see [GCP Resource Requirements](#gcp-requirements).

* Install the most recent version of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). To download the cf CLI, see [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) in GitHub.

* Create an SSL certificate for your PCF domain.
  <p class="note"><b>Note: </b>To deploy PCF to a production environment, you must obtain a certificate from a certificate authority. Pivotal recommends using a self-signed certificate generated by Ops Manager for development and testing purposes only.</p>

* Assign administrative rights to a domain for PCF. You need to be able to add wildcard records to this domain. You specify this registered domain when configuring the SSL certificate and Cloud Controller for PCF. For more information see the [Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point](../opsguide/security_config.html) topic.

* Create a wildcard DNS record that points to your router or load balancer. Alternatively, you can use a service such as xip.io. For example, `203.0.113.0.xip.io`.
  <p class="note"><b>Note: </b> With a wildcard DNS record, every hostname in your domain resolves to the IP address of your router or load balancer. For example, if you create a DNS record `*.example.com` pointing to your router, every app deployed to the `example.com` domain resolves to the IP address of your router.</p>

* Create at least one wildcard TLS certificate that matches the DNS record you configured.

* Create one or more NTP servers, if the NTP servers are not already provided by your GCP project.

* Configure sufficient IP allocation. For more information about IP allocation requirements, see [PAS Resource Requirements](#pas).

* (Optional) Configure external storage. Pivotal recommends using external storage if possible. For more information about how file storage location affects platform performance and stability during upgrades, see [Configure File Storage](../upgrading/configuring.html#file-storage).

* (Optional) Configure external databases. Pivotal recommends using external databases in production deployments for BOSH Director and PAS. An external database must be configured to use the UTC timezone.

* (Optional) Configure external user stores. When you deploy PCF, you can select a SAML user store for Ops Manager or a SAML or LDAP user store for PAS, to integrate existing user accounts.
