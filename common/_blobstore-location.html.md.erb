Select a **Blobstore Location** to either configure the blobstore as an internal server or an external endpoint. Because the internal server is unscalable and less secure, Pivotal recommends you configure an external blobstore.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After you deploy Ops Manager, you cannot change the blobstore location.</p>![Blobstore location options in the Director Config pane](../common/images/gcp/blobstore.png)
  * **Internal**: Select this option to use an internal blobstore. Ops Manager creates a new VM for blob storage. No additional configuration is required.
