For **Certificate Duration Overrides**, you can choose whether certificates generated within Ops Manager and CredHub use the default duration specified for the certificate or a custom duration value that you specify, if the default duration is less than the configured value for that type of certificate.
  <%= image_tag("../common/images/duration-overrides.png", :alt => "Three fields including the On-Off option for the feature, CA Certificate Duration (days) text field with 1460 as value, Leaf Certificate Duration (days) with 730 as value, and a link to the documentation for the feature.") %>
  * **Off:** Select this option to use default durations for certificates created by all products.
  * **On:** Select this option to set a value to override the duration for certificates created by all products. If a product creates a certificate with a longer duration than the value you set, the longer duration is used.
        1. **CA Certificate Duration (days):** Enter the number of days for which CA certificates are valid.
        1. **Leaf Certificate Duration (days):** Enter the number of days for which leaf certificates are valid. This value must be less than or equal to the CA Certificate Duration.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After you set certificate duration overrides, you must take additional steps to apply the setting to all certificates.
