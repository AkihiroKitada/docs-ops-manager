For **Set Minimum Certificate Duration**, you can choose whether certificates generated within Ops Manager and CredHub use the default duration specified for the certificate or a custom minimum certificate duration value that you specify.
  * **Off:** Select this option to use the default durations for certificates created by all products.
  * **On:** Select this option to customize the minimum duration for certificates created by all products. If a product creates a certificate with a longer duration than the value you set, the longer duration is used.
        1. **CA Certificate Validity Duration (days):** Enter the minimum number of days for which CA certificates are valid.
        1. **Leaf Certificate Validity Duration (days):** Enter the minimum number of days for which leaf certificates are valid. This value must be lower than the CA certificate validity duration.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After you set a new certificate duration, you must take additional steps to apply the setting to all certificates.
