For **Customize Certificate Duration**, you can choose whether certificates generated within Ops Manager and CredHub use the default duration specified for the certificate, or to use a minimum duration instead if the specified duration is less than the minimum for that type of certificate.
  * **Off:** Select this option if you want to use the default durations for certificates created by all products.
  * **On:** Select this option if you want to set a minimum duration for certificates created by all products. If a certificate is created by a product with a longer duration than the corresponding minimum duration setting, the longer duration will be used.
