A PCF deployment includes both your chosen runtime and Ops Manager. Ops Manager is the dashboard for administering the runtimes and services within your PCF deployment.

BOSH Director is a tile within Ops Manager. The BOSH Director tile, deployed as part of the Ops Manager installation, assists in configuring your deployment's environment settings.

Example runtimes and services managed though Ops Manager include, but are not limited to, Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

Example environment configurations managed by the BOSH Director tile include, but are not limited to, availability zone settings, VM sizing, and CF Networking settings.
